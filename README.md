# SpringBox 
This program simulates active particles in a viscous fluid in two dimensions.
Activated particles interact by pairwise interactions, and effectively through
the coupling with the fluid. The fluid is treated entirely in the Stokesian
limit and is solved with 2D-Stokeslets.

Feel free to use the code to play with your systems. A good starting point for
your experimentation is probably the example.py file, which generates a simple
simulation. Please note that because this is a research code, I cannot
guarantee that any features will remain unchanged.
